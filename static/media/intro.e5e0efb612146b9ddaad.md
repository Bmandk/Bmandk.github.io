You've reached the start of my blog!
This blog is made with a few purposes in mind:

1. To figure out how to make a blog with React (done!)
2. To communicate what I learn, be it through university or other means
3. Post future development logs for game development
4. Be able to post analyses (of games) online
5. Recount events, gamejams, conferences etc.

There probably won't be a schedule, or any kind of structure on this blog.
I just thought it would be neat to have one, and a place to put my thoughts, as
I have found that I learn a lot through articulating. I rarely just sit down and
think about things, so I'm hoping this will help me learn more. Enjoy!
