**Game Description**  
IdleConquest was a project made during my bachelors. The project was an independent research project
with another student and a supervisor. We made an idle game to research what motivations for
playing them are.

**Project Description**  
The game has the player try to conquer the world by hiring army units (e.g. soldiers, cavalry,
generals) that will seize human settlements (e.g. villages, cities, nations). The player can then
buy tax collectors to have the cities generate money. The approach of the project was mainly using a
theory called Self-Determination Theory, which posits that we can be intrinsically or extrinsically
motivated in our behaviour. To test how this theory applies to idle games, we made a prototype
called IdleConquest. This was made with some research on other idle games and adding what we think
could be interesting. We then designed an experiment, where we stripped a feature for 3 separate <!-- "adding what we think could be interesting" hvad er det? -->
games to send out to people. This way we were able to measure how each feature performed. We
measured and analyzed this using the SDT theory.
