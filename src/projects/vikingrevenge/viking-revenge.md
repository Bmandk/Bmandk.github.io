For this game, I challenged myself to make a game in one month. As I was also a student, the time spent
on this project was very limited. This was my first solo project, so I did everything myself. The game
was very much a joke, based on the long-term joke that Danes hate Swedes.

Since I am not an artist by trade, I decided to go with pixel art. While it is not the most beautiful
(by far), to me it was a lot easier to make something mediocre and recognizable than with a higher
resolution.
