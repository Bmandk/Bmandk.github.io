Pacha is an exploratory adventure game, set in a forest that is about to be cut down.
You play as Pacha, and at first your objective is to gather food for you and your cubs.
But you will quickly realize that humans are encroaching on your forest,
cutting down all the trees. You must stop them, and in the process become stronger.
Pacha can burrow into the ground, and then launch into the to overcome various obstacles.

Pacha was made by 17 people in six weeks while attending <a href="http://www.dadiu.dk/">DADIU</a>.
We were a brand new team, having no experience as a team before. What I learned most
from this project was teamwork, having to work with other game designers, programmers,
a sound designer, quality assurance/user researchers, an art director, a game director,
and a producer. I learned about rational game design, and used one-pagers and prototypes
to design and communicate the game design. Since I was also the lead, I had also had
to have an overview of the other game designers, making sure we were doing the right
tasks, and communicating a lot with the other departments.
