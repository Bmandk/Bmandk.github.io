                    <h3>Game Designer</h3>
                    <p>
                        Video games have always been a part of my life. I have been gaming since I was 10 years old. In 2012 I started on
                        GameIT College, where my game development journey started. I learned to write code and focused on
                        programming. I have experience with hardware, with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, and various sensors. This
                        affords me to create custom hardware for the games I make (i.e. Guitar Hero controller). After this,
                        especially when I started at the IT-University of Copenhagen, I got into game design. It was a lot more
                        interesting, as dealing with people was a lot more unpredictable. With my strong background in
                        programming, it places me as a strong core gameplay designer as I'm able to quickly prototype new games.
                        In my future I'd like to get better at graphics and statistics/data analysis to become a better game
                        designer.

                        In my spare time, I make games, play guitar and piano, hang with friends, and
                        enjoy snowboarding when possible.
